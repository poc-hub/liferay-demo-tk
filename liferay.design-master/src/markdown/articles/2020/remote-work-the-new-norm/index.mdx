About a year and a half ago, I started researching in preparation for writing our department's policy on remote work. Of course this research included plenty of hours on Design Twitter™️ — but it also included actual research, reading books like:

-   [Remote](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson
-   [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport
-   [Make Time](https://maketime.blog/) by Jake Knapp
-   [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563) by David Allen

As well as [other books, podcasts, and articles](/handbook/work/references).

As I began sharing and discussing these ideas with other designers, we quickly came to a couple of conclusions:

1. We're _already operating under a "remote" paradigm_. We have designers spread across multiple timezones — Brazil, Spain, Italy, Germany, the US, and more.
1. Working remotely isn't actually all that different — sure Slack or Zoom calls aren't as convenient as turning to the designer or engineer next to you — maybe that's a good thing?
1. Working in a remote first mindset is _more accessible and inclusive_ — it helps everyone as it encourages written, asynchronous communication.
1. We're very fortunate to be able to exercise our craft without absolutely needing to be in an in-person, office environment.
