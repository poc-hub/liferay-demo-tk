Templates offer prebuilt solutions to tackle repetitive interface challenges. They speed up the design process, as they only require minor modifications to fit your use case and display your content.

Our more frequent templates are:

* [Builder template](./builder-template): used for building sites, forms, low-code apps, experiences
* [Dataset template](./dataset-template): used in applications where listing information is needed
* [Forms template](./forms-template): present in any application the requires data gathering
* [Settings template](./settings-template): allows us to visually organize the first face of our settings screens, like system or instance settings
