## In loving memory.

_by Juan Hidalgo Reina_

Nate was the first designer and the early Design advocate at Liferay.

He always pursued the idea that Design should be meaningful.

He wasn’t only a great designer; he was a great UI Developer.

He was the founder of our Team.

He showed us the way and guided us for six years.

You never heard a negative thing or complaint from him.

He loved Flamenco guitarists.

Nate was an artist; illustration, music, etc.

He convinced us to move forward always; it didn’t matter the challenges, barriers, etc.

He was a dreamer, honest, creative, passionate, smart, and funny — a great friend to all.

He loved Liferay.

Always one of us.
