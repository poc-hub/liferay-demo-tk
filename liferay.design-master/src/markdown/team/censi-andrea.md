## How did you get into design?

I’ve designed for fun since I was a child. I joined the design world thanks to a friend who introduced me to Photoshop and since then I’ve never stopped.

## Favorite tool?

For drawings and sketches I mainly use Figma. For UX and interactions I mainly use Principle.

## Best lifehack?

A good espresso coffee is what usually jump-starts my day.

## Where do you find #inspiration?

In general I look for inspiration pretty much everywhere: a color, an eye-catchy font in a commercial … also, my instagram home is flooded with UI/UX ideas.

## One thing you are getting better at?

I feel like I’m improving more and more with animations/interactions. Good UX always has to start from a straightforward interaction. Aside from static UI, thinking in terms of animations is a good way to verify or revise UX choices.

## If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

I think I would have opened a garage to customise motorcycles

## Advice for ambitious designers?

Trying to always have fun and be passionate about this job. I think this is a very good way to grow both professionally and personally At least it is for me. :)
